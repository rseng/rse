This week for the Research Software Encyclopedia Software Showcase we move into the world
of experiment orchestration and data management. This includes features like:

 - streaming data
 - metadata
 - cross-hardware compatibility
 - interruption recovery
 - suspend or resume
 - exportable formats
 - customization
 - interface with scientific python

If you too are like me and have never tried a library like this, I recommend
starting with the [tutorial](https://blueskyproject.io/bluesky/).

Are you already familiar with this software? We encourage you to contribute to the [research software encyclopedia](https://rseng.github.io/rse/tutorials/annotation/) and annotate the respository:

<ul>
<li><a href="{{ page.annotate_criteria }}" target="_blank">Annotate the software criteria</a></li>
<li><a href="{{ page.annotate_taxonomy }}" target="_blank">Annotate the software taxonomy</a></li>
</ul>

otherwise, keep reading!

## What is bluesky?

BlueSky is actually two things - the [BlueSky Project](https://blueskyproject.io/) is a community cenered around
experimental science, and [bluesky](https://blueskyproject.io/bluesky/) is a software library that happens to belong
to this project. If you look at the image in the post above, it shows how different libraries (in blue) work together
to help you with your experiments. The BlueSky software (one of those libraries) is specifically the orchestration
component. It allows you to:

 - describe your experiment logic without needing to think about hardware
 - interact with (collect) streaming data
 - preserve metadata
 - pause or resume experiments

If you are not an instrumentalist or you've never worked with hardware, this library might seem very
different from what you usually see. This is exactly why we chose it for the RSEPedia software
showcase this week. Let's walk through a short example from the tutorial. We can start
and assume that a [Run Engine](https://blueskyproject.io/bluesky/tutorial.html#the-runengine) has
been configured for us. From the tutorial, it looks like this controls data storage
and visualization. Once we have a run engine (RE) we can run an [experimental plan](https://blueskyproject.io/bluesky/tutorial.html#common-experiments-plans) using it. Let's first read a set of simulated
detectors. We can import them from the `ophyd` library:

```python
from ophyd.sim import det1, det2  # two simulated detectors
```

Now let's import the bluesky plan to count, which is what we call reading the detectors.
We will hand this plan to our run engine (RE)

```python
from bluesky.plans import count
dets = [det1, det2]   # a list of any number of detectors

RE(count(dets))
```
```python
# five consecutive readings
RE(count(dets, num=5))

# five sequential readings separated by a 1-second delay
RE(count(dets, num=5, delay=1))

# a variable delay
RE(count(dets, num=5, delay=[1, 2, 3, 4]))
```

Here is what output might look like:

```python
Transient Scan ID: 1     Time: 2020-12-18 01:45:37
Persistent Unique Scan ID: 'af3aa0bc-58e8-4022-8899-9c7ef93c31f4'
New stream: 'primary'
+-----------+------------+------------+------------+
|   seq_num |       time |       det2 |       det1 |
+-----------+------------+------------+------------+
|         1 | 01:45:37.0 |      1.213 |      0.000 |
+-----------+------------+------------+------------+
generator count ['af3aa0bc'] (scan num: 1)



Out[2]: ('af3aa0bc-58e8-4022-8899-9c7ef93c31f4',)
```

This example is taken right from the [tutorial](https://blueskyproject.io/bluesky/tutorial.html#common-experiments-plans) and of course hugely fails to do justice for what the library can do! It's recommended to try it out
yourself.

#### Why is it useful?

When doing some kind of analysis with living, changing data, it's important to not only be able to retrieve
it programatically, but also to be able to 
freeze the version of the data that you use. By downloading an entire snapshot in time, this makes
it easy to do your analysis over the dataset without having it change on you!

## How do I cite it?

There is an [applied paper](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11493/1149311/Introduction-of-the-Sirepo-Bluesky-interface-and-its-application-to/10.1117/12.2569000.short?SSO=1) that 
introduces the library:

```
@inproceedings{10.1117/12.2569000,
author = {Maksim S. Rakitin and Abigail Giles and Kaleb Swartz and Joshua Lynch and Paul Moeller and Robert Nagler and Daniel B. Allan and Thomas A. Caswell and Lutz Wiegart and Oleg Chubar and Yonghua Du},
title = {Introduction of the Sirepo-Bluesky interface and its application to the optimization problems},
volume = {11493},
booktitle = {Advances in Computational Methods for X-Ray Optics V},
editor = {Oleg Chubar and Kawal Sawhney},
organization = {International Society for Optics and Photonics},
publisher = {SPIE},
pages = {209 -- 226},
keywords = {Sirepo, SRW, Bluesky, Databroker, Ophyd, optimization, simulations},
year = {2020},
doi = {10.1117/12.2569000},
URL = {https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2569000}
}
```

And an [example](https://www.bnl.gov/ps/docs/pdf/NSLS2-Strategic-Plan.pdf) of how the library
was included in a strategic plan.

<ul>
  <li><a href="{{ page.annotate_criteria }}" target="_blank">Annotate the software criteria</a></li>
  <li><a href="{{ page.annotate_taxonomy }}" target="_blank">Annotate the software taxonomy</a></li>
</ul>

or read more about annotation [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/annotate-your-software). You can clone the software repository to do
bulk annotation, or annotation any repository in the <a href="https://rseng.github.io/software/" target="_blank">software database</a>,
We want annotation to be fun, straight-forward, and easy, so we will be showcasing one repository to annotate per week.
If you'd like to request annotation of a particular repository (or addition to the software database)
please don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/rseng/software/issues) or even a pull request.
