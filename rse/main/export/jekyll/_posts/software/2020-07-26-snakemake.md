This week for the sofware survey we are highlighting <a href="https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake" target="_blank">snakemake/snakemake</a>, a workflow manager for Python that makes it easy to create and run a workflow from a high performance computing environment
to a cloud provider.

<a id="what-is">
## What is snakemake?

From the [snakemake documentation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/):

> The Snakemake workflow management system is a tool to create reproducible and scalable data analyses. Workflows are described via a human readable, Python based language. They can be seamlessly scaled to server, cluster, grid and cloud environments, without the need to modify the workflow definition. Finally, Snakemake workflows can entail a description of required software, which will be automatically deployed to any execution environment.

The great thing about Snakemake is that is empowers scientific programmers, many of which are comfortable with
Python, to create and execute workflows at scale. At the same time, you can store them in a GitHub repository.
And this shows in it's usage! Did you know that (as of the writing of this post) Snakemake gets about [3 new citations per week](https://badge.dimensions.ai/details/id/pub.1018944052)?

## How do I contribute to the software survey?

<ul>
<li><a href="{{ page.annotate_criteria }}" target="_blank">Annotate the software criteria</a></li>
<li><a href="{{ page.annotate_taxonomy }}" target="_blank">Annotate the software taxonomy</a></li>
</ul>

or read more about annotation [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/annotate-your-software). You can clone the software repository to do
bulk annotation, or annotation any repository in the <a href="https://rseng.github.io/software/" target="_blank">software database</a>,
We want annotation to be fun, straight-forward, and easy, so we will be showcasing one repository to annotate per week.
If you'd like to request annotation of a particular repository (or addition to the software database)
please don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/rseng/software/issues) or even a pull request.
