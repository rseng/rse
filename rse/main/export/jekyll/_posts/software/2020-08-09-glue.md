Earlier this week, I was captured by <a href="https://twitter.com/zenrhino/status/1291039195834781697?s=27" target="_blank">this tweet</a>.

<br>

When you think about it, we take a lot of our software for granted. The fact that <a href="https://twitter.com/zenrhino" target="_blank">@zenrhino</a> 
went out of his way to say "Hey, this library is great!" was a sign from the software gods that I 
needed to showcase it for the software showcase this week. Without further ado, let's
highlight the <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/glue" target="_blank">tidyverse/glue</a> package!
If you already know about glue, we encourage you to contribute to the [research software encyclopedia](https://rseng.github.io/rse/tutorials/annotation/) and annotate the respository:

<ul>
<li><a href="{{ page.annotate_criteria }}" target="_blank">Annotate the software criteria</a></li>
<li><a href="{{ page.annotate_taxonomy }}" target="_blank">Annotate the software taxonomy</a></li>
</ul>

otherwise, keep reading!

<a id="what-is">
## What is glue?

At face value, Glue sounds a lot like <a href="https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/" target="_blank">Python format strings</a>, because you can throw all kinds of expressions into strings and have them evaluated:

> Glue offers interpreted string literals that are small, fast, and dependency-free. Glue does this by embedding R expressions in curly braces which are then evaluated and inserted into the argument string.

For example, here is formatting a name into a string using Glue in R:

```R
library(glue)
name = "Dinosaur"
glue('My name is {name}.')
# My name is Dinosaur.
```

and here is the same thing in Python, which will work for Python 3.6 and greater:
 
```python
name = "Dinosaur"
print(f"My name is {name}")
```

But it does a little more than that, because as the tweet noted, `glue_sql` has been a lifesaver!
You can easily convert your R namespace into an sql query to submit:

```R
glue_sql("SELECT * FROM {`tbl`} WHERE species IN ({vals*})",
  vals = c("setosa", "versicolor"), .con = con)
```

but that's just a tiny example, and I won't do the library justice in this post! Check out
the:

üëâÔ∏è [Glue Documentation](https://glue.tidyverse.org/)

for more examples. And check out the [entire thread](https://twitter.com/zenrhino/status/1291039195834781697)
for a lot more examples of valuable, yet under-valued software! [Let us know](https://github.com/rseng/rseng/issues) if you'd like a package
to be featured on the software showcase. 


<a id="cite">
## How do I cite it?

To cite package ‚Äòglue‚Äô in publications use:

```
  Jim Hester (2020). glue: Interpreted String Literals. https://github.com/tidyverse/glue,
  https://glue.tidyverse.org/.
```

The BibTeX entry for LaTeX users looks like:
```

  @Manual{,
    title = {glue: Interpreted String Literals},
    author = {Jim Hester},
    year = {2020},
    note = {https://github.com/tidyverse/glue, https://glue.tidyverse.org/},
  }

```

<a id="getting-started">
## How do I get started?

 - [Tidyverse Glue Reference](https://glue.tidyverse.org/reference/glue.html) with basic examples.
 - [Transformers](https://glue.tidyverse.org/articles/transformers.html)
 - [Speed of Glue](https://glue.tidyverse.org/articles/speed.html)

You can also post questions on the [GitHub issues board](https://github.com/tidyverse/glue/issues).

This is just one library! Just think of the sheer number of libraries that we use on a daily basis
that we might take for granted. Let's not do that anymore - let's decide to showcase our software,
even if it's just a small shoutout.


<a id="contribute">
## How do I contribute to the software survey?

<ul>
<li><a href="{{ page.annotate_criteria }}" target="_blank">Annotate the software criteria</a></li>
<li><a href="{{ page.annotate_taxonomy }}" target="_blank">Annotate the software taxonomy</a></li>
</ul>

or read more about annotation [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/annotate-your-software). You can clone the software repository to do
bulk annotation, or annotation any repository in the <a href="https://rseng.github.io/software/" target="_blank">software database</a>,
We want annotation to be fun, straight-forward, and easy, so we will be showcasing one repository to annotate per week.
If you'd like to request annotation of a particular repository (or addition to the software database)
please don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/rseng/software/issues) or even a pull request.
