Are you already familiar with nodepy? We encourage you to contribute to the [research software encyclopedia](https://rseng.github.io/rse/tutorials/annotation/) and annotate the respository:

<ul>
<li><a href="{{ page.annotate_criteria }}" target="_blank">Annotate the software criteria</a></li>
<li><a href="{{ page.annotate_taxonomy }}" target="_blank">Annotate the software taxonomy</a></li>
</ul>

otherwise, keep reading!

## What is Nodepy?

Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are extremely useful tools for describing multiple coupled quantities changing over time in deterministic settings. For example, they are used for modelling the motion of planets, electrical circuits, and dynamics of biological systems. In many cases they cannot be solved exactly and require numerical solutions. Numerical ODEs have developed as their own branch of mathematics, concerned with both accuracy and stability of solutions. NodePy is a Python library for numerical ODEs.

NodePy has been cited multiple times by practitioners, fuelling further development for years. It is based on Python's SymPy and NumPy libraries, and optionally NetworkX, CVXPY, and Scipy for specific algorithms.


#### Why is it useful?

In addition to having multiple algorithms 'out of the box', it also allows users to experiment with their own. There is a collection of tools with a common interface that helps users study the properties of these various algorithms. For example, it can determine stability and numerical accuracy automatically. NodePy is not meant to just be a collection of algorithms, but a tool to help students and practitioners develop and understand their own algorithms.

## How do I contribute to the software survey?

<ul>
  <li><a href="{{ page.annotate_criteria }}" target="_blank">Annotate the software criteria</a></li>
  <li><a href="{{ page.annotate_taxonomy }}" target="_blank">Annotate the software taxonomy</a></li>
</ul>

or read more about annotation [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/annotate-your-software). You can clone the software repository to do
bulk annotation, or annotation any repository in the <a href="https://rseng.github.io/software/" target="_blank">software database</a>,
We want annotation to be fun, straight-forward, and easy, so we will be showcasing one repository to annotate per week.
If you'd like to request annotation of a particular repository (or addition to the software database)
please don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/rseng/software/issues) or even a pull request.
