This week for the sofware survey we are highlighting <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy" target="_blank">sunpy/sunpy</a>, a Python library for Solar Physics. [SunPy](https://sunpy.org/) handle both data analysis and visualization, and has quite a lovely logo!

I've made it big intentionally - do you notice anything? The middle is in fact a snake, and you can see his tongue too! 

## Annotate Away!
If you want to jump right in, you can:

<ul>
<li><a href="{{ page.annotate_criteria }}" target="_blank">Annotate the software criteria</a></li>
<li><a href="{{ page.annotate_taxonomy }}" target="_blank">Annotate the software taxonomy</a></li>
</ul>


or learn more about it in the following sections.

<a id="what-is">
## What is sunpy?

How does our sun, or more generally, a star like it, influence the surrounding planets and galaxy? [Solar physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_physics) is essentially the domain of science that aims to answer these kinds of questions.
Sunpy is closely related in development to [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org/), and both community libraries
aim to provide data analysis and visualization for solar physics researchers. In fact, look at this beautiful shot
of our sun, generated by Sunpy!

<a id="why-created">
## When was it created?

SunPy was created in 2011, and the package (and community!) is exciting because it can empower you to analyze a huge set of growing solar physics data. To get a sense of what is possible, you should check out the sunpy examples gallery:

üëâÔ∏è [sunpy examples gallery](https://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/generated/gallery/index.html) 

In fact, if you love Python, or are inspired by this kind of work, SunPy (via NumFocus) is [looking for a contract developer](https://numfocus.org/uncategorized/scientific-software-developer-contract-basis-sunpy-project). This
job was advertised on the [us-rse jobs board](https://us-rse.org/jobs).

<a id="cite">
## How do I cite it?

See [this section of the website](https://sunpy.org/about.html#acknowledging-or-citing-sunpy)
for two notable publications (one shown below):

<a id="getting-started">
## How do I get started?

If you want to get started with sunpy, the following resources are suggested:

 - [The "Brief Tour" in the SunPy Documentation](https://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/guide/tour.html)
 - [The SunPy Example Gallery](https://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/generated/gallery/index.html)
 - [SunPy Tutorial Notebooks](https://github.com/sunpy/tutorial-notebooks)

And of course you can ask questions or post issues on the [GitHub issues board](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/issues).

<a id="contribute">
## How do I contribute to the software survey?

<ul>
<li><a href="{{ page.annotate_criteria }}" target="_blank">Annotate the software criteria</a></li>
<li><a href="{{ page.annotate_taxonomy }}" target="_blank">Annotate the software taxonomy</a></li>
</ul>

or read more about annotation [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/annotate-your-software). You can clone the software repository to do
bulk annotation, or annotation any repository in the <a href="https://rseng.github.io/software/" target="_blank">software database</a>,
We want annotation to be fun, straight-forward, and easy, so we will be showcasing one repository to annotate per week.
If you'd like to request annotation of a particular repository (or addition to the software database)
please don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/rseng/software/issues) or even a pull request.

<a id="learn-more">
