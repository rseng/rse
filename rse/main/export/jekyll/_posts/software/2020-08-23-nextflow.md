> You know I'm all about those workflows, about those workflows, no trouble! I'm all  about those workflows, about those workflows, no trouble!

Seriously, workflow managers and orchestration tools make the scientific computation world go round! 
Our showcase would simply not be complete without sharing <a href="https://www.nextflow.io" target="_blank">Nextflow</a>,

If you already know about NextFlow, we encourage you to contribute to the [research software encyclopedia](https://rseng.github.io/rse/tutorials/annotation/) and annotate the respository:

<ul>
<li><a href="{{ page.annotate_criteria }}" target="_blank">Annotate the software criteria</a></li>
<li><a href="{{ page.annotate_taxonomy }}" target="_blank">Annotate the software taxonomy</a></li>
</ul>

otherwise, keep reading!

<a id="what-is">
## What is Nextflow?

There are many good choices of <a href="https://github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline" target="_blank">workflow managers</a> for scientific
pipelines, and NextFlow is definitely one of the leaders! What makes it special?

> Nextflow is a bioinformatics workflow manager that enables the development of portable and reproducible workflows. It supports deploying workflows on a variety of execution platforms including local, HPC schedulers, AWS Batch, Google Cloud Life Sciences, and Kubernetes. Additionally, it provides support for manage your workflow dependencies through built-in support for Conda, Docker, Singularity, and Modules.

But what makes NextFlow stand out is the user community! There is an entire repository, <a href="https://github.com/nextflow-io/awesome-nextflow" target="_blank">nextflow-io/awesome-nextflow</a> with easily ~170 community pipelines. Working on community workflows, or modules
for workflows, is a great way to practice reproducible science.

One cool thing about NextFlow is that the creators created a company called <a href="https://seqera.io/" target="_blank">Seqera</a>,
which seems to offer biomedical analyses as a service, called <a href="https://seqera.io/#section-tower" target="_blank">Tower</a>.
I haven't tried any of the services, but it's empowering to see that an open source project can figure out a service
model to be sustainable. You can also check out <a href="https://github.com/seqeralabs/nf-tower" target="_blank">Tower on GitHub</a>.
Please let me know if you try it out!

## How do I get started?

You might visit any of the following links!

 - [The GitHub Repository](https://github.com/nextflow.io/nextflow) is always a good place to start.
 - [Community Pipelines](https://github.com/nextflow-io/awesome-nextflow) on GitHub
 - [Getting Started](https://www.nextflow.io/index.html#GetStarted)
 - [NextFlow on Gitter](https://gitter.im/nextflow-io/nextflow)

## How do I contribute to the software survey?

<ul>
  <li><a href="{{ page.annotate_criteria }}" target="_blank">Annotate the software criteria</a></li>
  <li><a href="{{ page.annotate_taxonomy }}" target="_blank">Annotate the software taxonomy</a></li>
</ul>

or read more about annotation [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/annotate-your-software). You can clone the software repository to do
bulk annotation, or annotation any repository in the <a href="https://rseng.github.io/software/" target="_blank">software database</a>,
We want annotation to be fun, straight-forward, and easy, so we will be showcasing one repository to annotate per week.
If you'd like to request annotation of a particular repository (or addition to the software database)
please don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/rseng/software/issues) or even a pull request.
