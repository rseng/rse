Welcome to the first edition of the Software Survey! This is a weekly showcase
of software will teach you a little bit about possibly new library, and request
your quick annotation of the software for criteria and taxonomy categories.
This week we are showcasing <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/rtweet" target="_blank">ropensci/rtweet</a>

If you want to jump right in, you can:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://rseng.github.io/software/repository/github/ropensci/rtweet/annotate-criteria/" target="_blank">Annotate the software criteria</a></li>
<li><a href="https://rseng.github.io/software/repository/github/ropensci/rtweet/annotate-taxonomy/" target="_blank">Annotate the software taxonomy</a></li>
</ul>

or learn more about it in the following sections.

## What is rtweet?

[rtweet](https://rtweet.info/) is an R client to interact with the Twitter API. This means that
you can easily "scrape" data from Twitter for a personal, academic, or other kind of project.
Examples might include creating:

 - a map of tweets that meet some filter criteria
 - a network graph that shows users and followers
 - looking at frequencies of various kinds of tweets over time to make inferences

## How do I cite it?

See [this page](https://rtweet.info/authors.html) for details on citation.

## How do I contribute to the software survey?

<ul>
<li><a href="https://rseng.github.io/software/repository/github/ropensci/rtweet/annotate-criteria/" target="_blank">Annotate the software criteria</a></li>
<li><a href="https://rseng.github.io/software/repository/github/ropensci/rtweet/annotate-taxonomy/" target="_blank">Annotate the software taxonomy</a></li>
</ul>

or read more about annotation [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/annotate-your-software). You can clone the software repository to do
bulk annotation, or annotation any repository in the <a href="https://rseng.github.io/software/" target="_blank">software database</a>,
We want annotation to be fun, straight-forward, and easy, so we will be showcasing one repository to annotate per week.
If you'd like to request annotation of a particular repository (or addition to the software database)
please don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/rseng/software/issues) or even a pull request.
