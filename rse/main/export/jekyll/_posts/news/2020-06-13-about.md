Welcome to <b>Rseng</b>, an endpoint to find research software criteria and taxonomy. This interface
deploys a versioned taxonomy and set of criteria for research software. 

<!--more--> 

Both the taxonomy and criteria set are available programmatically via the <a href="https://github.com/rseng/rseng" target="_blank">rseng</a>
software, and used by the <a href="https://github.com/rseng/rse" target="_blank">Research Software Encyclopedia</a>
to better understand research software. You can browse the taxonomy or criteria items
from [home]({{ site.baseurl }}/), or do a search in the bar at the top. Both are
also available via JSON export thanks to a static json api:

 - [Taxonomy JSON]({{ site.baseurl }}/api/taxonomy/)
 - [Criteria JSON]({{ site.baseurl }}/api/criteria/)

All of these tools are hugely under development, so stay tuned for more, or jump in to help!
