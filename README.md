The Research Software Encyclopedia (rse) is software to query and otherwise interact 
with a database of research software, and a research software taxonomy.
It is intended for research software engineers to be able to better qualify
and quantify the work that they do. The rse uses the following resources:

 - [rseng/rseng](https://rseng.github.io/rseng/): serves the taxonomy and criteria
 - [rseng/software](https://github.com/rseng/software): is a static (flat file) "database" that is updated automatically.

Unlike traditional software databases, the rse and supporting tools are completely
hosted and automated without need to manage a server.
The rse works by way of regularly scraping known research software databases,
and then adding entries to [rseng/software](https://github.com/rseng/software).
Users are then (also automatically) prompted to answer questions about criteria
and taxonomy via social media and chat (not developed yet).  Non-traditional
use cases for the rse are generating a static web-site of your own research 
software! See [the tutorials](https://rseng.github.io/rseng/blog/) section of the 
criteria and taxonomy site to get started.

Read the [documentation](https://rseng.github.io/rse/) to get started with interacting with the 
research software encyclopedia.
